    <h2>Devon Ludwig</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Devon Ludwig. I am sorry I am late to the party. I have two kids and my wife is pregnant with
        our third! Life is moving pretty fast for us. I come from a family of four and my wife comes from a family of eight. All
        of her siblings are girls. Something that is super wierd is that my mom is a triplet and my dad is a twin. 
    </p>
    <p>I love to be out doors. My kids and I frequently go offroading near R mountain. My family and I just finished buying
        all of our essential camping gear and can't wait to use it this summer. I love extreme watersports like wakeboarding
        and surfing. I grew up with a boat and we were out on the lake a lot. 
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member all of my life and love the gospel. I strive to center it in my life daily. With school coming to
        a close for me that begins to be harder because of my more difficult classes. Next semester will be my final semester. 
        I am studying Data Science and do not plan on changing anytime soon!
    </p>
